Awesome Clicker is an educational Odoo module that demonstrates how to build an interactive clicker game using the OWL (Odoo Web Library) frontend framework. Designed as part of the "Master the Odoo Web Framework" tutorial series, this project introduces key frontend development concepts such as systray items, client actions, services, and reactive state management. The game includes progressive features like automated clicking (bots), milestone unlocks, rewards, and persistent state storage using local storage. It serves as a practical and modular example for learning modern Odoo web development.
